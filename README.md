# RAG-Oceanfishrema
面向海洋渔业资源管理的开源 产学研落地工程系统。专为渔业管理、科研、公益场景提供检索增强问答与决策辅助。

基于ThinkRAG框架进行二次开发，https://github.com/wzdavid/ThinkRAG  严禁用于任何盈利或商业用途。

受限于文件体积与保密要求，完整数据与训练权重未随仓库存放，但按官方文档即可复现运行环境。

🔍数据自主：已整合1GB的海洋渔业论文、期刊、数据库等。

🧠模型训练：基于Qwen-2.5的指令微调+强化学习（DPO）。仓库中给出专业模型的部分训练结果，也可使用自己的模型。经过评测，对比市面上的通用大模型存在信息检索等方面的优势。

🎤功能扩展：添加了水质监控和语音输入的功能。

# RAG-Oceanfishrema
Open source industry university research implementation engineering system for marine fishery resource management. Specially designed to provide retrieval enhanced Q&A and decision-making assistance for fisheries management, scientific research, and public welfare scenarios.

Based on the ThinkRAG framework for secondary development, https://github.com/wzdavid/ThinkRAG It is strictly prohibited to use it for any profit or commercial purposes.

Due to limitations in file size and confidentiality requirements, the complete data and training weights were not stored in the warehouse, but the operating environment can be replicated according to official documentation.

🔍 Data autonomy: 1GB of marine fishery papers, journals, databases, etc. 

🧠 Model training: Instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (DPO) based on Qwen-2.5. Partial training results of professional models are provided in the warehouse, and one can also use their own model. After evaluation, it was found that there are advantages in information retrieval compared to general large models on the market.

🎤 Function extension: Added water quality monitoring and voice input functions.
